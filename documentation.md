### CLOUDINARY CHROMA KEYING

## Introduction

Chroma keying describes the technique used for combining two frames or images by replacing a color or a color range in one frame with that from the another frame. This is common in use cases such as making movies or weather forecasting.
This article demonstrates how a video's green screen color can be filtered out using javascript.

## Codesandbox

The final project can be viewd on [Codesandbox]().

<CodeSandbox
title="CLOUDINARY CHROMA KEYING"
id=" "
/>

You can get the github source code here [Github]()

## Prerequisites

Prior entry-level understanding of javascript and react

## Project Setup

In your project directory create a new Nextjs app using [create-next-app CLI](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/cli) :

`npx create-next-app chromaKeying`

Head to the directory
`cd chromaKeying`

You can use `npm run dev` to run nextjs server localy.
Delete all the contents in the `pages/index` directory and replace them with the following

```
`pages/index`


import Processor from '../components/Processor';
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Processor />
    </div>
  )

```

In the code above, our root component contains a function named Home which imports a component named Processor, imported from the directory `components/Processor`. You will build this directory by creating a folder named `components` and inside it create a new file named `Processor.jsx`. in the `Processor.jsx` file start by creating a functional component like shown below

```
`pages/index`


export default function Processor() {
  return (
    <div>
      works
    </div>
  )
```

This should be enough to run the browser with the page looking as shown:
![First processor component instance](https://res.cloudinary.com/dogjmmett/image/upload/v1644213681/works_ahmamd.png 'component works')

### BACKEND

With the components set up, we'll continue by first setting up the project backend. The backend will handle the app's cloudinary online storage and provide the uploaded video's cloudinary link.

We start by configuring cloudinary environment variables in our application. Head to the official cloudinary website. The cloudinary website contains a free tier which can be accessed though this [link](https://cloudinary.com/?ap=em). Sign up and login to access your account dashboard. An examplae of dash board will be as follows
![Cloudinary Dashboard](https://res.cloudinary.com/hackit-africa/image/upload/v1623006780/cloudinary-dashboard.png 'Cloudinary Dashboard').

The three environment variables will be the `Cloud name` , `API Key` and `API Secret`.
To use them, head back to your project root directory and create a file named `.env`. Inside it paste the following code

```
`.env.local`


CLOUDINARY_NAME =

CLOUDINARY_API_KEY =

CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
```

Fill in the blanked spaces with your respective environment variables and restart your project.

With our keys set up, head to the`pages/api` folder and create a file named `cloudinary.js`. This is where we will code our upload function.

Start by pasting the following code

```
`pages/api/cloudinary.js`


  var cloudinary = require('cloudinary').v2;

cloudinary.config({
    cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_NAME,
    api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
    api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
});
```

The above code simply configures the cloudinary envs to our component. Below it paste the following function

```
`pages/api/cloudinary.js`


export default async function handler(req, res) {
    let uploaded_url = '';
    const fileStr = req.body.data;

    if (req.method === 'POST') {
        try {
            const uploadedResponse = await cloudinary.uploader.upload_large(fileStr, {
                resource_type: "video",
                chunk_size: 6000000,
            });
            uploaded_url = uploadedResponse.secure_url;
            console.log(uploaded_url)
        } catch (error) {
            console.log(error);
        }
        res.status(200).json({ data: uploaded_url });
        console.log('complete!');
    }
}
```

The above is a nextjs handler function that will receive a request body from the frontend
and upload it for online storage. On uploading, the code will capture the uploaded file's cloudinary url and assign it to the `uploaded_url` variable, which will be sent back to front end as a response.

With the above handler function our backend is complete!

## FrontEnd

Front end is simply the part of our project involving direct user interraction.

Earlier, we had created our component and if you run the project you can still see the content from the `Processor` component.

Inside the `components/Processor.jsx` directory, start by pasting the necessary imports at the top of the page. We will only need one

```
import { useState, useRef } from 'react';
```

Inside the `Processor` function, paste the following

```
`pages/index.js`

  let video, canvas, outputContext, temporaryCanvas, temporaryContext;
  const canvasRef = useRef();
  const [computed, setComputed] = useState(false);
  const [link, setLink] = useState('');
```

Each of the above variables will be understood as we move on.

Replace your function's return statement with the following code,

```
`pages/index.js`

<>
            <header className="header">
                <div className="text-box">
                    <h1 className="heading-primary">
                        <span className="heading-primary-main">Cloudinary Chroma Keying</span>
                    </h1>
                    <a href="#" className="btn btn-white btn-animated" onClick={computeFrame}>Remove Background</a>
                </div>
            </header>
            <div className="row">
                <div className="column">
                    <video className="video" crossOrigin="Anonymous" src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dogjmmett/video/upload/v1632221403/sample_mngu99.mp4' id='video' width='400' height='360' controls autoPlay muted loop type="video/mp4" />
                </div>
                <div className="column">
                    { link ? <a href={link}>LINK : {link}</a> : <h3>your link shows here...</h3>}
                    <canvas className="canvas" ref={canvasRef} id="output-canvas" width="500" height="360" ></canvas><br />
                </div>
            </div>
        </>
```

The above code should simply create a UI that users will be interracting with. The UI will be like below
![Project UI](https://res.cloudinary.com/dogjmmett/image/upload/v1663346008/Screenshot_2022-09-16_at_19.33.09_pcw0bl.png 'Project UI').

If the page has not shown up, dont worry, that's because the `REMOVE BACKGROUND` button contains an onClick function named `computeFrame`. Let's create it. Above the return statement, paste the following

```
`pages/index.js`

 const computeFrame = () =>{

}
```

Your UI should work by now.

Let us modify our `computeFrame` function. When this function is fired, the function should remove the green color from the video and maintain the foreground. Therefore start by pasting the following inside it

```
`pages/index.js`

        video = document.getElementById("video")

        temporaryCanvas = document.createElement("canvas");
        temporaryCanvas.setAttribute("width", 800);
        temporaryCanvas.setAttribute("height", 450);
        temporaryContext = temporaryCanvas.getContext("2d");

        canvas = document.getElementById("output-canvas");
        outputContext = canvas.getContext("2d");

```

Above, we begin using the variables created earlier. the `video` variable refferences the video element in our return statement. We've then then created a temporary canvas element and assigned it to the `temporaryCanvas` variable then configured its width and height property. We assign its context to the `temporaryContext` variable.
The `temporaryContext` variable will be used to fetch the current video frame as image and pass the video size and element using the drawImage method.

```
`pages/index.js`


        temporaryContext.drawImage(video, 0, 0, video.width, video.height);
        let frame = temporaryContext.getImageData(0, 0, video.width, video.height);
```

We can now remove the green screen background. Our sample image data is in single dimentional array format. This means that the the image begins with the first row's pixel then followed by the next on in the same row. this happens over the following row repeatedly till the whole image is covered.There are 4 data in each pixel, 3 RGB values and an alpha transparency. That means four array spaces followed by an array size that is four times the original pixel number.
We will create a loop that checks all pixels' RGB value and get the value for each pixel by multiplyimg index by four and adding an offset. R, the first value for each pixel will get zero offset while G and B will get 1 and 2 offset respectively.

```
`pages/index.js`

for (let i = 0; i < frame.data.length / 4; i++) {
            let r = frame.data[i * 4 + 0];
            let g = frame.data[i * 4 + 1];
            let b = frame.data[i * 4 + 2];

        }
```

At this point, we can confirm each pixel's RGB value that resembles the green color and set their alpha value to zero which will remove the green screen. This will modify our the code above as follows

```
`pages/index.js`

    for (let i = 0; i < frame.data.length / 4; i++) {
      let r = frame.data[i * 4 + 0];
      let g = frame.data[i * 4 + 1];
      let b = frame.data[i * 4 + 2];

      if (r >= 0 && r < 55 && g > 170 && g < 180 && b >= 0 && b < 8) {
        frame.data[i * 4 + 3] = 3;
      }
    }

    outputContext.putImageData(frame, 0, 0)
    setTimeout(computeFrame, 0);
```

Better results can be achieved through a more advanced algorithm but for our case, this should be enough. Use the setTimeout to recursively call itself and create a rendering loop.

Your green screen should be able to dissappear at this point.

Next, we record our animated canvas as a webm file using MediaRecorder API for cloudinary upload.

Create a contsant to upload recorded media chunks

```
`pages/index.js`

const chunks = [];
```

Create another to refference our canvas element using useRef hook

```
`pages/index.js`

   const cnv = canvasRef.current;
```

Grab the canvas MediaStream

```
`pages/index.js`

const stream = cnv.captureStream()
```

Initialize the recorder, and let it store data in our array each time the recorder has new data

```
`pages/index.js`

const rec = new MediaRecorder(stream);
        rec.ondataavailable = e => chunks.push(e.data);
```

A complete blob will be constructed when the recorder stops

```
`pages/index.js`

rec.onstop = e => uploadHandler(new Blob(chunks, { type: 'video/webm' }));
        rec.start();
```

you can also set the time the media stops recording. Our video will be 16 seconds long. For effective results we will shorten our output samples to be 5 seconds long. The video will create anothe sample every 5 seconds

```
setTimeout(() => rec.stop(), 5000);
```

In the above codes notice the `uploadHandler` function. If we run this project now, there will be an error `uploadHandler is not defined` . We solve this by creating the function itself.

```
async function uploadHandler(){

}
```

The function above will be used to send our webm files to the backend for upload.
Replace with its full code below

```
async function uploadHandler(blob) {
        await readFile(blob).then((encoded_file) => {
            try {
                fetch('/api/cloudinary', {
                    method: 'POST',
                    body: JSON.stringify({ data: encoded_file }),
                    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
                })
                    .then((response) => response.json())
                    .then((data) => {
                        setComputed(true);
                        setLink(data.data);
                    });
            } catch (error) {
                console.error(error);
            }
        });
    }
```

The function is an async function since it will involve an await expression to make promise returning function to act syncronous by suspending execution untill the promise is fullfiled.The resolved value will be the await expression's return value. Use the following [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) for better understanding of asyncronous functions. In our case, the await expression will use the blob prop from the `computeFrame` function. it will return a base64 encoded file awaited from a fileReader function. Paste the following to include your fileReader

```
function readFile(file) {
        return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
            let fr = new FileReader();

            fr.onload = function () {
                resolve(fr.result);
            };

            fr.onerror = function () {
                reject(fr);
            };

            fr.readAsDataURL(file);
        });
    }
```

A file reader allows us to asyncronously read our blob object contents. You can research on file reader through this [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader).

Back to our `uploadHandler` function, we will use a try catch function to fetch our backend and POST method to send our encoded file. Our response will be assigned to the earlier created `link` variable using a useState hook which will then be viewed in our front end incase user wishes to download the generated video content.

There are several factors to not here. As you develop,. First, be keen to testout and capture the right rgb pixel information in your code. Ensure to be in a stable internet connection environment for the canvas to be recorded properly as the video plays. You can enable `controls` or `loop` option in the video tag to play the video again incase it stops. Every sample will last 5 seconds. But you can choose your own timing from the `setTimeout` option inside the `computeFrame function`. This article has provided the necessary codes to remove the green screen from the video provided. Feel free to change it and alter the for loop to capture the right background frame. So far, We have created our own Javascript Chroma Keying sample. Try it out to enjoy the experience

Happy coding!
